One approach to manage CSS specificity issues is to use more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (though this is generally discouraged for maintainability).

Here's a modified CSS (`solution.css`) showing a possible solution:

```css
/* Using more specific selectors */
#my-element.my-class {
  color: green !important; /* Explicitly overriding other rules */
}

#my-element.another-class {
  color: purple;
}

/* Or, re-organize for better specificity control */
#my-element {
  color: blue;
}

#my-element.my-class {
  color: green;
}

#my-element.another-class {
  color: purple; /* Now it only applies to this class */
}

.my-class {
  color: red; /* Now this has lower specificity so it doesn't interfere*/
}
```

In this version, the `#my-element.my-class` selector has higher specificity and correctly applies the `green` color. Alternatively, re-organizing selectors addresses the conflict by making specificity explicit in the declaration order. This prevents unexpected style overwrites. Always keep in mind that using `!important` should be done sparingly and selectively. More specific selectors offer better maintainability.
